# Hello, I'm Mátyás János Gubis 👋

I'm a 27-year-old tech enthusiast from Hungary on a perpetual journey of exploration and learning. 
I can confidently say I have ventured into a wide array of technologies in the tech world.

## What's in My Arsenal:

- **Version Control**: GitLab, GitHub and Sourcetree are like old friends.
- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, HTML, SCSS, and a little dance with Python.
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and the delights of React, Vue.js, Angular, and Material UI.
- **Back-end**: I have experience with Node.js, Express and Next.JS. I'm well-versed in socket.io and REST APIs.
- **Development Practices**: I play in the Agile sandbox, mastering Scrum, DevOps, and the art of code reviews.
- **Containerization**: Docker is my go-to for packaging up applications.
- **Databases**: Whether SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase), I can handle them.
- **ORMs**: I've dabbled in Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, and Drizzle.
- **Architectural Styles**: MVC and the intricate world of microservices.
- **Java wizardry**: Spring Boot, Swing, JDBC, Streams, and a pinch of functional programming.
- **Build Tools**: Maven and Gradle have crossed my path.

## Constantly Curious

I'm like a sponge 🧽, eager to soak up new knowledge 🧠 and technologies 🔬. 
I've had a friendly encounter with RFID readers, NFC tags, and IoT, and I'm curious to delve deeper.
My eagerness to explore the unknown keeps me engaged and motivated to acquire new skills.

## A Problem Solver and Team Player

I thrive both in teamwork and when flying solo. Pressure and responsibility? Bring it on.
I don't just see myself as a programmer but rather as a problem solver. 
I love thinking outside the box 📦 and understand that mistakes are stepping stones to success 🚀. 
I'm not deterred by failures; instead, I embrace them as learning opportunities 📖. 
With a pinch of perseverance, I believe every challenge can be surmounted.

## Future Endeavors

In the quest for knowledge, I aim to explore Django, automation, smart home tech, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. 
The world of tech is an ever-evolving canvas, and I'm ready to keep painting my story.

## Beyond the Keyboard

Beyond the realms of coding, I've tested my creativity 🖌️ using Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and also experienced with some video editing using Premiere Pro and After Effects.
I also enjoy bringing 3D models alive with my 3D printer, and using them for my adventures in DnD 🎲.

## Let's Collaborate

I look forward to connecting and collaborating with you in either 🇭🇺 Hungarian, 🇬🇧 English or 🇩🇪 German. 
Let's embark on this exciting journey together! 🗺️
